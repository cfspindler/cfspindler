- 👋 Hi, I’m @cfspindler, better know as Charlie. By day I am a senior engineer for large international consulting firm. It says 
civil engineer on my license, but I am a generalist. By night, I solder dev boards together and code C++ on PlatformIO. 
- 👀 I’m interested in communications and engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use GitHub and to improve my coding skills.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Meshtastic. It's a sub gigahertz low bandwidth long range chirp modulation spread sprectrum
mesh-networked radio device that is used by outdoors people off the grid and for comms everywhere when the cell towers are down.  I 
am especially interested in contributing to the development of their Serial Communications Plugin, if I can do so usefully. 
- 📫 How to reach me:  Probably best is my email address: cfspindler@gmail.com . If you're in or near Boise, Idaho, we could have a 
cup of coffee if this damned Covid-19 pandemic would just dry up & blow away. We can colaborate anyway. I'll been doing serious 
engineering design out of my basement using Teams video for a year and a half.  It's the new normal.
